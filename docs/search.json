    "text": "AIM: To link cancer pathways (including screening, diagnosis, staging, and outcomes) across primary care and secondary care. To identify areas of inequality in screening and late diagnosis, and to generate predictive insights for risk and screening recall.\nSUMMARY: Cancer has long been a challenging area for data-driven initiatives. Primary care coding of cancer is often incomplete, as the majority of care following referral takes place in hospitals. The most readily available secondary care data is from Commissioning Data Sets, which are only complete for inpatient care, and may not include the majority of cancer events. Within hospitals, the largest quantity of cancer data sits within audit datasets, or within unstructured text and clinic letters, which are not easily accessible.\nThis results in significant limitations. First, it is difficult to reconcile screening data with diagnostic outcomes. Second, only an incomplete picture of cancer diagnoses can be obtained at the ICB level, including of disease severity following delayed referral or prolonged waiting time. Finally, it is difficult to gain understanding of how such pathways impact on overall treatment outcomes and cancer recurrence.\nThe SDE programme provides opportunities to surface and link currently missing data, to provide an end-to-end overview of key cancer pathways. The figure below shows cancer data flows within the SDE ecosystem (Figure 1). This work is complementary to additional work with FLIP to make cancer imaging and digital pathology data available, to support precision medicine research in the same patient cohorts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n    d1[GP Surgeries] ==&gt;|\"Primary care\n                        coded cancer data\"| LDS1[(London Data Service)]\n    d2[NHS Digital] ==&gt;|\"National Disease\n                      Registration Service\"| LDS1\n    AIC1[\"CogStack in Trusts\"] ==&gt;|\"Cancer staging, diagnosis,\n                                      from unstructured text\"| AIC2\n    LDS1 ==&gt; AIC1a[\"CogStack in LDS\"]\n\n    AIC1a ==&gt; |\"Cancer presentation, symptoms,\n              from unstructured GP text\"| LDS1\n\n    d3[Hospital Trusts] ==&gt;|\"Cancer registry and \n                            audit datasets\"| AIC2\n\n    AIC2[\"AIC FLIP\"] ==&gt; |\"Hospital cancer data\n                          via federation\"| LDS1\n    \n    LDS1 ==&gt;|\"Linked cancer data\n            and federated analytics\"| ICB[(\"ICB / AIC Analytics Teams\")]\n\n    classDef green fill:#ab9, stroke:#333, stroke-width:1px\n    classDef blue fill:#89c, stroke:#333, stroke-width:1px\n    classDef bluegreen fill:#9ca, stroke:#333, stroke-width:1px\n    classDef lightblue fill:#ace, stroke:#333, stroke-width:1px\n    classDef red fill:#c89, stroke:#333, stroke-width:1px\n    classDef lightorange fill:#ca8, stroke:#333, stroke-width:1px\n    classDef orange fill:#d96, stroke:#333, stroke-width:1px\n    classDef purple fill:#a9c, stroke:#333, stroke-width:1px\n    classDef bluegray fill:#9ab, stroke:#333, stroke-width:1px\n    classDef gray fill:#fff, stroke:#333, stroke-width:1px\n\n    class LDS1 blue\n    class ICB lightblue\n    class AIC1,AIC1a,AIC2,AIC3 orange\n    class d1,d2,d3 bluegreen\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Summary of cancer data flows within the London SDE ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is expected that year one of the programme will consist of infrastructural work to enable these data flows, with a focus on two cancer areas, breast cancer and lung cancer.

    "section": "",
    "text": "AIM: To systematically surface multiple dimensions of health inequality across sociodemographic / geospatial groups, and across individual patients, and to monitor this data continuously across key long-term conditions.\nSUMMARY: Health inequality refers to differences in health outcomes and determinants between individuals or groups (e.g. morbidity, co-morbidity, disease complications/death, healthcare access, disease screening, treatment delivery). The principle of health equity emphasises the recognition and reduction of disparities in determinants, resulting in more equal outcomes.\nIt is important to understand what groups suffer from health inequality. This is traditionally measured and visualised as a comparison of disease and outcome prevalence/incidence across different population groups. While helpful for broad insights, this also offers limited understanding of complex individual circumstances and determinants. This use-case proposes that measurement of inequalities can be extended to individual patients, by using clinical domain knowledge to define ‘indicators’ of unequal disease, diagnosis, and treatment pathways. In an individual with a long-term condition (LTC), example indicators of inequality are shown below. The contribution of individual indicators to later outcomes can also be measured in multivariate statistical models, and used to understand determinants for any given individual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. LTC surfacing at an early age (Figure 1)\n\n\n2. LTC in proximity to relevant co-morbidities (e.g. cardiovascular risk factors)\n\n\n3. Diagnosis at a late age but with more severe disease (e.g. in Diabetes, measured by HbA1c or presence of end-organ complications)\n\n\n4. Reduced health engagement/encounters/treatment compared to what is expected based on disease severity\n\n\n5. Shorter time to complications and mortality following diagnosis\n\n\n\nThe objective is to move beyond describing inequality, to understanding individual/small group determinants, and to increase actionability. At this level, determinants can be visualised for small specific groups, or individuals, with comparison to ‘what is expected’ in a background population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Inequality in age of onset across demographic groups and deprivation, generated automatically through input of condition and group for stratification\n\n\n\nThe initial stage of work will include defining shared terminologies, concepts, and indicators that cover LTC of interest. Secondly, existing descriptions of health inequality can be migrated onto the LDS environment, and extended such that any condition can be reproducibly visualised across multiple dimensions and ‘cuts’. This foundation can be further extended to encompass specific inequality indicators and statistical insights, at a small group and individual level, and the use of these insights to identify patients at greatest risk of health inequality, or those with addressable determinants.",

FLIP is presently installed in four major London Trusts. Integrating FLIP into the SDE will enable hospital data (such as cancer data) to be surfaced into the LDS, and enable access to multi-modal data (such as DICOM imaging and digital pathology) for research in precision medicine.\nCogStack: As an advanced natural language processing platform, CogStack can turn the large quantities of health information that are found in narrative text, into structured and analysable data. Currently actively used in Trusts to assist with clinical coding from notes and clinic letters, CogStack can surface secondary care and cancer pathway data, and previously unseen primary care data, into the SDE ecosystem.\nAIC Data/AI Hub: The AIC hosts health data and AI implementation expertise, that will provide practical support in analytics engineering, clinical informatics, data science, and machine learning (ML) development and deployment. Primary aims are to (a) help Integrated Care Boards (ICB) migrate data pipelines and analytics into common data models and terminologies within LDS environments; (b) extend these into reproducible pipelines for data science and predictive analytics deployment; and (c) work together and provide training to make ICBs self-sufficient in these capabilities.

The burden of such diseases is high. Heart disease alone causes a quarter of deaths in the UK, with direct costs to the healthcare system estimated at £9 billion by the British Heart Foundation. Cardiovascular disease is seen as a priority area for use of data across OneLondon patient and public engagement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Existing ICB dashboard for Hypertension\n\n\n\nIn London ICBs, there is robust aggregate understanding of LTC, through prevalence reporting and Quality Outcome Framework (QOF) indicators. Existing ICB dashboards (Figure 1) show how a practice or a system are performing relative to their peers. However, such reporting has limitations, including: (1) lack of adjustment for demographics and other confounding variables; (2) difficulty in surfacing individual patients with direct actions; and (3) lack of consideration of complex co-morbidity phenotypes. This last is particularly important, as multi-morbidity changes the risk profile and urgency of response for individuals. Some of these limitations are being addressed by existing work in London pathfinder programmes, and in other regions such as Greater Manchester, which are moving towards electronic identification of patients who may be actioned via pre-agreed clinical pathways (Figure 2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n    A[\"Patient has CKD, \n      but is not on a Statin\"] ==&gt; A1[\"Assess and consider \n                                        starting a Statin\"]\n\n    B[\"HbA1c high in two consecutive years,\n      but patient not identified as Diabetic\"] ==&gt; B1[\"Code for Diabetes, and invite\n                                                    for clinical assessment and education\"]\n\n    C[\"Patient has Hypertension and Diabetes, \n      is on BB (where ACEi is recommended)\"] ==&gt; C1[\"Assess and consider \n                                                      medication switch\"]\n\n\n    classDef white fill:#fff, stroke:#333, stroke-width:1px\n    classDef gray fill:#eee, stroke:#333, stroke-width:1px\n\n    class A,B,C white\n    class A1,B1,C1 gray\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Examples of simple logical triggers leading to clinical actions. CKD = Chronic Kidney Disease; BB = Beta-blocker; ACEi = ACE inhibitor.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese limitations can be surmounted through using richer data to generate personalised risk profiles for individual patients (rather than aggregate group summaries). A previous collaboration between the AIC and North-East London ICB was able to develop precise cardiovascular risk prediction models for individuals, using explainable machine learning algorithms and the linked patient health record. Actionable factors could also be highlighted in patients with high risk, with their relative importance explained through statistical modelling to enhance explainability (Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Actionable factors (including follow-up, treatment, blood pressure control) and association of features with adverse outcome in high risk hypertensive patients\n\n\n\nPredictive analytics alone are not a solution. Patients identified as “high risk” may have few clinical factors that can be optimised, and non-specific risk stratification is known to lead to increased resource utilisation without improving outcomes. Instead, this use-case proposes the use of validated clinical guidelines and domain knowledge to identify specific optimisation or preventative actions - much like Figure 2, but systematically, and on a larger scale. The combination of predictive analytics and explicitly defined actions to support decisions, is known as “decision intelligence”.\nThis use-case will again first develop shared terminologies, features, and code to enhance current pipelines and dashboards. This is an opportunity for using new programme capabiltiies to extend existing work through:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1) Using CogStack to extract additional valuable context and missing codes from unstructured text to improve performance, and reduce potential for negative biases, in predictive models;\n\n\n(2) Computerising Quality Outcomes Framework targets and clinical guidelines, in conjunction with local clinical teams, to develop safe decision logic for use as part of an effector arm;\n\n\n(3) Using rich features in the EHR to develop statistical and machine learning models for predicting and understanding risk of progression and acute care utilisation across cardiovascular morbidity and co-morbidity;\n\n\n(4) For a given patient’s health record, understanding actions (i.e. are there actions available, and what are they), combined with explainable risks across multiple conditions (i.e. what are the highest risks for this patient and why), to support decision-making;\n\n\n(5) Returning individual patient insights and suggested actions to clinical systems such as EHR (EMIS) or the London Care Record\n\n\n\nHighly individualised patient profiles are the objective of personalised care, and are a key component of preventative healthcare. Any deployed systems will need to be evaluated and monitored for safety and fairness, with a process of training and handover to continuity teams following the end of this SDE programme phase.

    "text": "What is the London SDE?\nThe London Secure Data Environment (SDE) is part of a national programme to enable secure and more powerful analytics for NHS, academic, and commercial users. Uniquely amongst regional peers, the London SDE does not focus on a single research platform. Rather, it places a focus on developing data infrastructure and capabilities across the region to support population health, care providers, and commissioners. This is in addition to building data environments that enable commercial research and development partnerships.\nThe SDE is led by OneLondon, as part of an overarching London Health Data Strategy, coalescing around three components (Figure 1):\n\nLondon Data Service (LDS): hosted in North-East London, the LDS serves as a data engineering and service layer for pan-London primary care and secondary care data. It handles data extraction and linkage, and provisions data within secure analytics environments for both research and NHS users.\nDiscoverNOW Research/Analytics Environment: run by Imperial College Healthcare Partners in North-West London, DiscoverNOW supports governance and operation of secure research environments for academic, commercial, and NHS research and analytics.\nLondon AI Centre (AIC): a national centre of excellence for applied data science and AI, the AIC provides frontier technology for data enrichment (CogStack), federated analytics (FLIP), and deployment of machine learning tools, as well as expertise in health data and advanced analytics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n    d1[GP Surgeries] ==&gt;|Primary care data| LDS1[(London Data Service)]\n    d2[NHS Digital] ==&gt;|Commissioning datasets| LDS1\n    d3[Local data sources] ==&gt;|ICS data| ICB\n    AIC1[\"CogStack in Trusts\"] ==&gt;|\"Unstructured data \n                                          (hospitals)\n                                          via federation\"| LDS1\n    LDS1==&gt; AIC1a[\"CogStack in LDS\"]\n    AIC1a==&gt;|\"Unstructured data \n                (primary care)\"| LDS1\n    LDS1 ==&gt;|Linked data| NWL1[(\"DiscoverNOW Research & \n                                Analytics Environment\")]\n\n    AIC2[\"AIC FLIP\"] ==&gt; |\"Multi-modal data \n                                          (imaging metadata)\n                                          via federation\"| NWL1\n    AIC2 ==&gt; |\"Hospital cancer data\n                via federation\"| LDS1\n    LDS1 ==&gt;|Linked data| ICB[(\"Integrated Care Board 'Sandpits' \n                                x5: NEL/SEL/SWL/NWL/NCL\")]\n\n    ICB &lt;==&gt;|Collaborative analytics| AIC3[AIC Data/AI Hub]\n    ICB &lt;==&gt;|Output Sharing| LDS2[Terminology/Code/Model Servers]\n    AIC3 &lt;==&gt;|Output Sharing| LDS2\n    NWL1 &lt;==&gt;|Output Sharing| LDS2\n\n    classDef green fill:#ab9, stroke:#333, stroke-width:1px\n    classDef blue fill:#89c, stroke:#333, stroke-width:1px\n    classDef bluegreen fill:#9ca, stroke:#333, stroke-width:1px\n    classDef lightblue fill:#ace, stroke:#333, stroke-width:1px\n    classDef red fill:#c89, stroke:#333, stroke-width:1px\n    classDef lightorange fill:#ca8, stroke:#333, stroke-width:1px\n    classDef orange fill:#d96, stroke:#333, stroke-width:1px\n    classDef purple fill:#a9c, stroke:#333, stroke-width:1px\n    classDef bluegray fill:#9ab, stroke:#333, stroke-width:1px\n    classDef gray fill:#fff, stroke:#333, stroke-width:1px\n\n    class LDS1,LDS2 blue\n    class ICB lightblue\n    class AIC1,AIC1a,AIC2,AIC3 orange\n    class NWL1,NWL2 bluegray\n    class d1,d2,d3 bluegreen\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Summary of SDE components and data flows.
