Over the past few years, the London AI Centre has built the Federated Learning and Interoperability Platform (FLIP), a platform which provides both an interoperable secure data environment within each hospital’s firewall, and a mechanism to query data and train AI models across these secure enclaves without the need to transfer or centralise data.

To populate in-hospital secure data environments, data is transferred from multiple sources (@fig-flip-summary). These include Trusts’ patient records systems (observations, diagnosis, medicines, etc) and data extracted from reports and narrative text through language AI systems (CogStack). These are mapped into OMOP. Information is also extracted from medical image stores within hospital Picture Archiving and Communications Systems (PACS), with additional capabilities of loading digital pathology and other imaging modalities. Finally, imaging metadata is loaded into the OMOP radiology extension, enabling querying and selection of multi-modal data items. Each hospital contains a FLIP node, which includes infrastructure and Graphical Processing Unit compute (@fig-flip-compute), that support local analytics and training.

From a remote location, users are able to cross query information from multiple secondary care sites, perform analytics, and train AI models in a federated manner before bringing in model weights centrally.
