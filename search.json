To identify areas of inequality in screening and late diagnosis, and to generate predictive insights for risk and screening recall.\nSUMMARY: Cancer has long been a challenging area for data-driven initiatives. Primary care coding of cancer is often incomplete, as the majority of care following referral takes place in hospitals. The most readily available secondary care data is from Commissioning Data Sets, which are only complete for inpatient care, and may not include the majority of cancer events. Within hospitals, the largest quantity of cancer data sits within audit datasets, or within unstructured text and clinic letters, which are not easily accessible.\nThis results in significant limitations. First, it is difficult to reconcile screening data with diagnostic outcomes. Second, only an incomplete picture of cancer diagnoses can be obtained at the ICB level, including of disease severity following delayed referral or prolonged waiting time. Finally, it is difficult to gain understanding of how such pathways impact on overall treatment outcomes and cancer recurrence.\nThe SDE programme provides opportunities to surface and link currently missing data, to provide an end-to-end overview of key cancer pathways. The figure below shows cancer data flows within the SDE ecosystem (Figure 1). This work is complementary to additional work with FLIP to make cancer imaging and digital pathology data available, to support precision medicine research in the same patient cohorts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n    d1[GP Surgeries] ==&gt;|\"Primary care\n                        coded cancer data\"| LDS1[(London Data Service)]\n    d2[NHS Digital] ==&gt;|\"National Disease\n                      Registration Service\"| LDS1\n    AIC1[\"CogStack in Trusts\"] ==&gt;|\"Cancer staging, diagnosis,\n                                      from unstructured text\"| AIC2\n    LDS1 ==&gt; AIC1a[\"CogStack in LDS\"]\n\n    AIC1a ==&gt; |\"Cancer presentation, symptoms,\n              from unstructured GP text\"| LDS1\n\n    d3[Hospital Trusts] ==&gt;|\"Cancer registry and \n                            audit datasets\"| AIC2\n\n    AIC2[\"AIC FLIP\"] ==&gt; |\"Hospital cancer data\n                          via federation\"| LDS1\n    \n    LDS1 ==&gt;|\"Linked cancer data\n            and federated analytics\"| ICB[(\"ICB / AIC Analytics Teams\")]\n\n    classDef green fill:#ab9, stroke:#333, stroke-width:1px\n    classDef blue fill:#89c, stroke:#333, stroke-width:1px\n    classDef bluegreen fill:#9ca, stroke:#333, stroke-width:1px\n    classDef lightblue fill:#ace, stroke:#333, stroke-width:1px\n    classDef red fill:#c89, stroke:#333, stroke-width:1px\n    classDef lightorange fill:#ca8, stroke:#333, stroke-width:1px\n    classDef orange fill:#d96, stroke:#333, stroke-width:1px\n    classDef purple fill:#a9c, stroke:#333, stroke-width:1px\n    classDef bluegray fill:#9ab, stroke:#333, stroke-width:1px\n    classDef gray fill:#fff, stroke:#333, stroke-width:1px\n\n    class LDS1 blue\n    class ICB lightblue\n    class AIC1,AIC1a,AIC2,AIC3 orange\n    class d1,d2,d3 bluegreen\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Summary of potential cancer data flows within the London SDE ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is expected that year one of the programme will consist of infrastructural work to enable these data flows, with a focus on two cancer areas, breast cancer and lung cancer. This work will include the installation of technology such as CogStack and FLIP, and creating pipelines to standardise data into OMOP to enable linked querying and federated analytics.

The principle of health equity emphasises the recognition and reduction of disparities in determinants, resulting in more equal outcomes.\nIt is important to understand what groups suffer from health inequality. This is traditionally measured and visualised as a comparison of disease and outcome prevalence/incidence across different population groups. While helpful for broad insights, this also offers limited understanding of complex individual circumstances and determinants. This use-case proposes that measurement of inequalities can be extended to individual patients, by using clinical domain knowledge to define ‘indicators’ of unequal disease, diagnosis, and treatment pathways. In an individual with a long-term condition (LTC), example indicators of inequality are shown below. The contribution of individual indicators to later outcomes can also be measured in multivariate statistical models, and used to understand determinants for any given individual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. LTC surfacing at an early age (Figure 1)\n\n\n2. LTC in proximity to relevant co-morbidities (e.g. cardiovascular risk factors)\n\n\n3. Diagnosis at a late age but with more severe disease (e.g. in Diabetes, measured by HbA1c or presence of end-organ complications)\n\n\n4. Reduced health engagement/encounters/treatment compared to what is expected based on disease severity\n\n\n5. Shorter time to complications and mortality following diagnosis\n\n\n\nThe objective is to move beyond describing inequality, to understanding individual/small group determinants, and to increase actionability. At this level, determinants can be visualised for small specific groups, or individuals, with comparison to ‘what is expected’ in a background population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Inequality in age of onset across demographic groups and deprivation, generated automatically through input of condition and group for stratification\n\n\n\nThe initial stage of work will include defining shared terminologies, concepts, and indicators that cover LTC of interest. Secondly, existing descriptions of health inequality can be migrated onto the LDS environment, and extended such that any condition can be reproducibly visualised across multiple dimensions and ‘cuts’. This foundation can be further extended to encompass specific inequality indicators and statistical insights, at a small group and individual level, and the use of these insights to identify patients at greatest risk of health inequality, or those with addressable determinants.",

The burden of such diseases is high. Heart disease alone causes a quarter of deaths in the UK, with direct costs to the healthcare system estimated at £9 billion by the British Heart Foundation. Cardiovascular disease is seen as a priority area for use of data across OneLondon patient and public engagement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Existing ICB dashboard for Hypertension\n\n\n\nIn London ICBs, there is robust aggregate understanding of LTC, through prevalence reporting and Quality Outcome Framework (QOF) indicators. Existing ICB dashboards (Figure 1) show how a practice or a system are performing relative to their peers. However, such reporting has limitations, including: (1) lack of adjustment for demographics and other confounding variables; (2) difficulty in surfacing individual patients with direct actions; and (3) lack of consideration of complex co-morbidity phenotypes. This last is particularly important, as multi-morbidity changes the risk profile and urgency of response for individuals. Some of these limitations are being addressed by existing work in London pathfinder programmes, and in other regions such as Greater Manchester, which are moving towards electronic identification of patients who may be actioned via pre-agreed clinical pathways (Figure 2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n    A[\"Patient has CKD, \n      but is not on a Statin\"] ==&gt; A1[\"Assess and consider \n                                        starting a Statin\"]\n\n    B[\"HbA1c high in two consecutive years,\n      but patient not identified as Diabetic\"] ==&gt; B1[\"Code for Diabetes, and invite\n                                                    for clinical assessment and education\"]\n\n    C[\"Patient has Hypertension and Diabetes, \n      is on BB (where ACEi is recommended)\"] ==&gt; C1[\"Assess and consider \n                                                      medication switch\"]\n\n\n    classDef white fill:#fff, stroke:#333, stroke-width:1px\n    classDef gray fill:#eee, stroke:#333, stroke-width:1px\n\n    class A,B,C white\n    class A1,B1,C1 gray\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Examples of simple logical triggers leading to clinical actions.

A previous collaboration between the AIC and North-East London ICB was able to develop precise cardiovascular risk prediction models for individuals, using explainable machine learning algorithms and the linked patient health record. Actionable factors could also be highlighted in patients with high risk, with their relative importance explained through statistical modelling to enhance explainability (Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Actionable factors (including follow-up, treatment, blood pressure control) and association of features with adverse outcome in high risk hypertensive patients\n\n\n\nPredictive analytics alone are not a solution. Patients identified as “high risk” may have few clinical factors that can be optimised, and non-specific risk stratification is known to lead to increased resource utilisation without improving outcomes. Instead, this use-case proposes the use of validated clinical guidelines and domain knowledge to identify specific optimisation or preventative actions - much like Figure 2, but systematically, and on a larger scale. The combination of predictive analytics and explicitly defined actions to support decisions, is known as “decision intelligence”.\nThis use-case will again first develop shared terminologies, features, and code to enhance current pipelines and dashboards. This is an opportunity for using new programme capabiltiies to extend existing work through:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1) Using CogStack to extract additional valuable context and missing codes from unstructured text to improve performance, and reduce potential for negative biases, in predictive models;\n\n\n(2) Computerising Quality Outcomes Framework targets and clinical guidelines, in conjunction with local clinical teams, to develop safe decision logic for use as part of an effector arm;\n\n\n(3) Using rich features in the EHR to develop statistical and machine learning models for predicting and understanding risk of progression and acute care utilisation across cardiovascular morbidity and co-morbidity;\n\n\n(4) For a given patient’s health record, understanding actions (i.e. are there actions available, and what are they), combined with explainable risks across multiple conditions (i.e. what are the highest risks for this patient and why), to support decision-making;\n\n\n(5) Returning individual patient insights and suggested actions to clinical systems such as EHR (EMIS) or the London Care Record\n\n\n\nHighly individualised patient profiles are the objective of personalised care, and are a key component of preventative healthcare. Any deployed systems will need to be evaluated and monitored for safety and fairness, with a process of training and handover to continuity teams following the end of this SDE programme phase. This is the objective of on-going work by responsible AI and AI governance teams in the AI Centre.",

    "text": "A network of data flows\nWith the NHS under increasing strain, it has never been more important to use patient data effectively - as a resource for improving clinical and operational decision-making, but also as a valuable asset for research and therapeutics development. To achieve this, data must be extracted, curated, joined together, and made available for secure access. This has always been difficult due to the silo-ed nature of NHS electronic systems. Our objective is to break down these barriers to allow entire pathway data to be securely surfaced and flowed to trusted users (Figure 2). The infrastructure that enable these data flows, will also enable deployment of clinical analytics and machine learning tools to inform pathway and operational decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n\n    d1[GP Surgeries] ==&gt;|Primary care data| LDS1[(London Data Service)]\n    d2[NHS England] ==&gt;|Commissioning datasets| LDS1\n    d3[Local data sources] ==&gt;|ICS data| ICB\n\n    LDS1==&gt; AIC1a[\"CogStack in LDS\"]\n    AIC1a==&gt;|\"Unstructured data \n                (primary care)\"| LDS1\n    LDS1 ==&gt;|\"Linked primary and\n            secondary care data\"| NWL1[(\"DiscoverNOW Research & \n                                Analytics Environment\")]\n\n    AIC2[\"CogStack/OMOP CDM/DICOM\n         data lakes/FLIP in Hospitals\"]-.-&gt;|\"Multi-modal hospital \n                                data via federation\"|NWL1\n    AIC2 -.-&gt; |\"Hospital EHR data\n                via federation\"| LDS1\n    LDS1 ==&gt;|\"Linked primary and\n            secondary care data\"| ICB[(\"Integrated Care Board 'Sandpits' \n                                x5: NEL/SEL/SWL/NWL/NCL\")]\n\n    ICB &lt;==&gt;|\"Analytics and machine \n            learning collaboration\"| AIC3[AIC Roving Teams]\n    ICB &lt;==&gt;|Output Sharing| LDS2[\"Terminologies, Code, \n                                   Model Registries\"]\n    AIC3 &lt;==&gt;|Output Sharing| LDS2\n    NWL1 &lt;==&gt;|Output Sharing| LDS2\n\n    classDef green fill:#ab9, stroke:#333, stroke-width:1px\n    classDef blue fill:#89c, stroke:#333, stroke-width:1px\n    classDef bluegreen fill:#9ca, stroke:#333, stroke-width:1px\n    classDef lightblue fill:#ace, stroke:#333, stroke-width:1px\n    classDef red fill:#c89, stroke:#333, stroke-width:1px\n    classDef lightorange fill:#ca8, stroke:#333, stroke-width:1px\n    classDef orange fill:#d96, stroke:#333, stroke-width:1px\n    classDef purple fill:#a9c, stroke:#333, stroke-width:1px\n    classDef bluegray fill:#9ab, stroke:#333, stroke-width:1px\n    classDef gray fill:#fff, stroke:#333, stroke-width:1px\n\n    class LDS1,LDS2 blue\n    class ICB lightblue\n    class AIC1,AIC1a,AIC2,AIC3 orange\n    class NWL1,NWL2 bluegray\n    class d1,d2,d3 bluegreen\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Summary of London Secure Data Environment (SDE) components and data flows.

    "text": "A major output of technology development within the London AI Centre has been the Federated Learning and Interoperability Platform (FLIP). This provides an interoperable secure data environment within each hospital’s firewall, a mechanism to query and analyse data across these environments (‘Interoperability’), and a mechanism to train AI models (‘Federated Learning’) without the need to transfer or centralise data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: FLIP architecture overview\n\n\n\nTo populate in-hospital environments, data is loaded from multiple sources (Figure 1). These include electronic patient records systems (observations, diagnosis, medicines, etc) and data extracted from reports and narrative text through language AI systems (CogStack). These are transformed into OMOP. Information is also extracted from medical image stores within hospital Picture Archiving and Communications Systems (PACS), with additional capabilities for loading other imaging modalities and digital pathology. Imaging metadata is loaded into the OMOP radiology extension, enabling querying and selection of multi-modal data items.\nEach hospital hosts its own FLIP infrastructure, which includes Graphical Processing Unit compute (Figure 2) in an NVidia DGX-1 (8 x Nvidia A100). Processing is performed locally, eliminating the need to transfer vast quantities of imaging ‘big data’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: AIC on site infrastructure, currently installed in 7 NHS Trusts\n\n\n\nFrom a remote location, users are able to cross query information from multiple secondary care sites, perform analytics, and train AI models in a federated manner before bringing in model weights centrally.",
